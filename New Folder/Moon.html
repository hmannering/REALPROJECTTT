  <h1>Smurfs: Harmless Childhood Cartoon Characters or Anti-Semites?</h1>

      <td>The Klan is an organization of white supremacists who believe white people are the master race. The village was headed by Papa Smurf, a red-hat-wearing leader amongst the white-pointed-hat-wearing group. Similarly, the leader of the K.K.K.(known as the Grand Dragon) wears a pointy red hat.  There were also many episodes where they danced around fires much like one of the K.K.K's traditional rituals. Alongside the KKK speculations, "Nazi" influences can be seen in the appearances if some characters. The villain of the story, Gargamel, was a man who bore resemblance to a parody of a stereo-typical Jewish man with dark hair and prominent features. Also, among the Smurfs themselves there is only one female, with strangely Aryan features most prominently displayed by her long blond hair. In Nazi ideology, this is the ideal look a Caucasian gentile.</td>

            <p>The "Smurfs" was a cartoon that has been around for years, and typically ended each episode expressing strong moral values to teach kids. With this being said, it can be difficult to believe that the creator of this show, Pierre Cullimore (Peyo) was found to be a Nazi member and affiliated with the KKK. However, looking at different aspects of the cartoon itself may make it not so unbelievable.</p>
