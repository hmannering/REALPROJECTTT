<p><b><br>"Planned Obsolescence":</b></br>
    Is it possible that Apple is trying to keep up its renevue by rendering costumer's old devices useless so thta they have no choice but to buy a new Apple product? Catherine Rampell commented on her view of this idea in a 2013 article in the <i>New Yorks Time Magazine</i>:<br>
    At first, I thought it was my imagination. Around the time the iPhone 5S and 5C were released, in September, I noticed that my sad old iPhone 4 was becoming a lot more sluggish. The battery was starting to run down much faster, too. But the same thing seemed to be happening to a lot of people who, like me, swear by their Apple products. When I called tech analysts, they said that the new operating system (iOS 7) being pushed out to existing users was making older models unbearably slow. Apple phone batteries, which have a finite number of charges in them to begin with, were drained by the new software. So I could pay Apple $79 to replace the battery, or perhaps spend 20 bucks more for an iPhone 5C. It seemed like Apple was sending me a not-so-subtle message to upgrade.</br>
    <br>
  Furthermore, opening very basic apps has gotten much slower, and apps crashing to the home screen is much more frequent.However the other side to this theory is that there are "some factors" that might make the phone feel slower, even if it isn't. Updates can add features that strain the resources of our phones and apps might be developed for the new hardware and so run less well on older phones.
