    <P> Conspiracy theories usually deny consensus or popular human opinons and cannot be proved using historical or sciencentific evidence.The consiracy theory explains an event or set of circumstances as a result od a secret plot by usuallu powerful conspirators. There are many unproven conspiracy theories that are frequently related to crazy government plans or elaborate murder plots. </P>

    <h3> Why do people believe in conspiracy theories? </h3>

    <p> As species, one of our greatest strengths is our ability to find meaningful patterns in the world around us and to make inferences. We sometimes, however, see patterns and causal connections that are not there, especially when we feel that events are beyond our control.The attractiveness of conspiracy theories may arise from a number of cognitive biases that characterize the way we process information. “Confirmation bias” is the most pervasive cognitive bias and a powerful driver of belief in conspiracies. We all have a natural inclination to give more weight to evidence that supports what we already believe and ignore evidence that contradicts our beliefs. The real-world events that often become the subject of conspiracy theories tend to be intrinsically complex and unclear. Early reports may contain errors, contradictions and ambiguities, and those wishing to find evidence of a cover-up will focus on such inconsistencies to bolster their claims. </P>
