  <p><br><b>"Snake" News:</b></br> The idea of reptilians was created by David Icke, a conspiracy theorist who believes shape-shifting lizards control and manipulate Earth by taking on human form and obtaining political power, like through government and high-ranking business positions. He thinks that many of the world leaders are "reptilians." Icke formed his idea from science-fiction literature involving lizard people and turned it into an actual belief system involving numerous theories. These human reptiles are all about control and domination over every person in the world. They are even linked to being blood-drinking, flesh-eating, extraterrestrial creatures who have been controlling the human race since ancient times. Reptilians are against individuality and freedom by instead focusing on structure and control. A famous person who is commonly associated with the Reptilian Elite is the singer Justin Bieber. A footage of him being arrested shows something strange going on with his eyes. One may interpret that they shapeshifted into reptile-looking eyes. World leaders, such as Barack Obama, George W. Bush, and Queen Elizabeth II are also belived to be involved in the elite.
